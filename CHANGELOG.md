## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `blueline review <pkg@ver>` command with text and JSON output, `--registry`
  override, and a fail-closed `--yes` flag.
- `blueline install` command with sandboxed extraction and fail-closed script
  execution.
- npm registry client with SHA-512 integrity verification before extraction.
- Line-level diff engine against the last known-clean release.
- Heuristic verdict engine with an ASCII review card and stable JSON verdict
  schema.
- Interactive `[a]pprove · [h]old · [d]iff` prompt persisting clean versions
  to the SQLite store.
- OSV and GitHub Advisory revocation cache and engine.
- Sigstore / SLSA provenance and attestation surfacing.
- Policy-as-code via `blueline.toml` (advisories, provenance, allow/blocklists).
- `blueline ci` lockfile diff scanner and PR reporting.
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and agent tools (`blueline mcp`).
- npm/npx wrapper shim (`@blueline/cli`).
- GitHub composite Action for PR checks.
- SQLite store with known-clean baselines, advisory/provenance caches, and an
  audit log.

### Changed

- Hardened archive extraction, SSRF checks, and executor isolation to fail
  closed on any doubt.
- Bounded registry reads with exact limits for packuments, tarballs, and
  redirects.
- Validated package name grammar, scoped URLs, and terminal escape sequences.
- Optimized diff scanning performance.

### Fixed

- IPv6 mutation testing by eliminating redundant address checks.
- Redirect handling and false-equivalent bounds in registry metadata.

### Security

- Fail-closed on every parse, extract, and verify boundary.
- Mutation testing and supply-chain audits run on every PR (CI gate).
